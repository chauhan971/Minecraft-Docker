Dockercraft

A simple Minecraft Docker client, to visualize and manage Docker containers.
DockerCraft is a tool that allows users to manage Docker containers from within Minecraft. It works by creating a Minecraft server that runs a plugin called "DockerCraft." This plugin enables players to interact with Docker containers and images using in-game commands.

To use DockerCraft, players first need to have Minecraft installed on their computer. They then need to download and install the DockerCraft plugin on their Minecraft server. Once the plugin is installed, players can use commands to interact with Docker containers and images.
